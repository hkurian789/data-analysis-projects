# Data Analysis Projects
Portfolio of data analysis projects demonstrating Python, pandas and predictive modelling

## Projects:

1. **Pokemon Stat Predictions using OLS**
   - Cleaned and explored a Pokémon stats dataset, handling missing values and engineering features from numeric and categorical attributes.
   - Built an OLS regression model to predict total stat points, assessed performance using RMSE and R², and checked for multicollinearity with VIF.
   - Interpreted results to highlight model strengths and limitations, explaining why certain feature choices improved variance explained but sometimes increased prediction error.
  
2. **Life Expectancy from WHO Data (group project)**
   - Developed an OLS regression model to predict life expectancy using WHO data, performing data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and feature engineering (OHE, scaling, log transforms).
   - Addressed ethical and bias considerations, ensuring outliers and missing data were handled responsibly to maintain fair representation of all countries.
   - Assessed the performance of the model using train/test RMSE, condition number, and summary statistics, providing insightful and accurate conclusions.
   - Shared contributions for the 'EDA', 'Ethics', 'Feature engineering' and 'Build and evaluate model' sections, solo contributions for the 'Duplicates' and 'Outliers' sections.
